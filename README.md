# steam-ps4-bridge
Push "now playing" status from PS4 to Steam (theoretical)

This project is current in the research phase.  It has not yet been implemented.

# Required setup:
PC running steam-ps4-bridge must be on same LAN as PS4

# Goal
While playing a game on PS4, your steam status will show you as "in-game", ideally with the name of that game.
